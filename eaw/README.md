# EAW Mod Editor
EAW Mod Editor is developed by my solo-organization 'NorthStar Colorblind' and is built for creating mods and templates for them in a quick matter of seconds.
This came upon my mind when developing a mod and thinking 'Wow, this is really slow-' so I began development from that point- which leads us to today!

# Functionality
* Creating Mods folders in both Source and FoC versions of the game
* Creating the Mod folder and SubFolders
* Editing UniqueUnits.XML
* UI is finished, so it looks as sleek as I could.
* Optimization

# To-Do
* Copying starter files to SubFolders
* Starting UI and Audio edits
* Completing Character edits
* More Optimization

# General Plan
* You start up the program, choose either to mod Source or FoC
* Choose what to edit; characters, audio or ui.
* Characters: Leads you to a new window with both 'Character Info' and 'Code' as tabs, code will have more customizability but Character Info will be easier to use.
* Audio: Leads you to a new window which allows you to drop audo in, or remove audio already imported and it converts files properly
* UI: Leads you to a new window that does the same as Audio, only with the images
* There will also be a button in the top left of the Startup menu which will lead you to the final window, which will allow you to open the mod, change certain files, modify events and more.
